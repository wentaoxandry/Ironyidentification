# Ironyidentification
Implementation of our Profiling Irony and Stereotype Spreaders on Twitter (IROSTEREO) at PAN 2022 <a href="https://pan.webis.de/clef22/pan22-web/author-profiling.html#evaluation">challenge</a>.  We train the BERTweet and a combination of BERTweet with CNN models with segmentation strategy. Three different loss functions are applied to deal with the unbalanced produced by the segmenting strategy. Soft-voting methods help us obtain the best results. Our model achieves the best performance in the IROSTEREO challenge.

### How to run the code
